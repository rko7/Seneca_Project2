This is because the copy assignment operator deletes data from the current 
object. So if we not self check it may cause duplication and delete the original
data which lead to data loss.
We must do delete in the copy constructor before calling the copy assignment 
operator. After memory removed the copy assignment operator will modify its 
object.
If the parameter of the copy constructor is sent by-value not by-reference, 
infinite loop occurs. This means that when you create an object from outside, 
the copy constructor is called to do so. However, the copy constructor is passed 
by value without receiving the original reference. If the function receives a 
parameter as a value, the parameter is copied to the calling side, which is 
called again, and an infinite loop occurs.
A copy constructor is a constructor that is called when creating a copy of an 
object. It copies the information of another object and initializes its own 
information. If you omit the copy constructor, the compiler will create a 
default copy constructor. The copy constructor and objects of other classes 
initialize parameter passing. The copy constructor exclusively handles the newly 
created object and the original object. The parallel copy creator attempts to 
copy and attempt to copy. The copy constructor is used when an object is passed 
as an argument to a function, and when the function returns an object as a 
return value, when a new object is initialized the same as an existing object 
of the same class type. If the code does not have a copy constructor, the 
compiler automatically generates an implicit copy constructor.
If the code does not have a copy constructor, the compiler automatically 
generates a default copy constructor.
The implicit copy constructor thus created performs a shallow copy. Copies the 
value of each member. The implicit copy constructor is created as shown in the 
commented out code above. However, if you are allocating memory dynamically 
within a class, a shallow copy is very likely to be dangerous. At this point, 
the programmer must create a copy constructor and execute a deep copy. Make deep 
copies when solving problems caused by shallow radiation. Each allocates memory 
to solve the problem.  Instead of sharing one space with another, each one has 
space.
