If I try to put my template functions in Data.cpp I will have an error when I 
compile it. The template function embodied at compile time. Therefore, it is a 
problem if the implementation is in another header file or cpp file. In other 
words, in order to concrete the template, the template definition must be in the 
same header file or cpp file. Therefore, declaring a template in a header file 
and defining a template in a cpp file causes compilation errors at compile time. 
So these is why I move all functions to Data.h, my source code compile without 
errors.
We need to define the template function above the main (). The thing that we 
include header is the same as connecting the code there, so it works. However, 
if it is below the main function, it may not work because the main function is 
not defined when it is executed.
We can do this through function overloading on integers and doubles. However, it 
works same except for the difference in parameters. So it looks like creating a 
duplicate function even though the parameter types are different. But with the 
template function, we do not need to use the same function twice for different 
parameters. It will allow all types but works the same way. Also, since the 
program is made before the program is executed, it does not slow down the 
program even if we use it a lot.
They are logically same. However, there are some situations that you have to use 
only one of them. If you use a type associated with another template parameter, 
you can only use <typename T>. When explicitly instantiating a template, you can 
only use <class T>. Also you must use <class T> in the case when the type 
declaration of a template declaration contains a template.
A template is a framework in which functions and classes are created in advance 
to be called regardless of their data types. The reason for writing a template 
is that existing functions need to define a new function even if the function 
and content are the same when the type is different. However, if you use a 
template, even if the data type is different, the compiler will call it if you 
define only one template. The number of codes is reduced and it is easier for 
the programmer. There is a drawback that it can slow down because it copies 
functions at compile time, but this is not the speed of execution, so it is 
advantageous to use a template if you do not have to worry about compilation 
speed. The specialization of the function template allows the user to 
arbitrarily define a template function of a predetermined type, so that when the 
template is called with the corresponding data type, the created function is 
called. The reason for this is that if you put a string in a function template 
that simply compares the size of two variables, it will pass the address value, 
so if the return value does not appear as intended, it will be used as a 
function template specialization. Like a function template, a class can be 
defined as a template. But there are some differences. Unlike a function 
template, it is not possible to omit a data type declaration when calling a 
class template. Class templates are also separable declarations and definitions. 
You also need to insert a separate cpp file into the main file, or define the 
template without splitting the template. You can also create an object with a 
class template, and you can put an object of a class template as an argument to 
a parameter of a general function, or you can declare a friend as a general 
function inside a class template. Class templates can also be specialized, such 
as function templates, for the purpose of applying a specific behavioral style 
to the type. However, there is a 'specialization' that specializes only one of 
several parameters.
