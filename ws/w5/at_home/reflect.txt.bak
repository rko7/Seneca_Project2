The operators use local variables that are used only by functions. After 
function has ran, the life cycle of the variable is over and it will be 
terminated. So if we return a reference to a variable which is not a copy, it 
returns a reference to the end variable. Then the garbage value will be 
generated. This is why we should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
For the temporary objects in the tester module I used "greater", "lesser", "mn",
"mx", "g_c_d", "found", "cOr", "rGcd", "oNumerator", "oDenominator".
I used isEmpty() and reduce() to minimize duplication.
The c ++ language allows operators to be defined on objects, allowing operators 
to be redefined for objects. So you can make certain operators have multiple 
meanings. This is 'operator overloading'. When a function is overloaded, it 
provides various functions with the same number of overloaded numbers. They are 
separated by the number of arguments and the data type of the arguments. 
Likewise, operator overloading adds other functionality beyond the existing 
functionality of the existing operator. The overloading of operators is 
necessary because of the appearance of objects. Existing operators (+, -, *, /,
%, + =, == etc.) are those that could be applied to basic datatypes. Operator 
Overloading allows you to define operators that target objects. That is, when 
the operator is overloaded, the operation method is changed according to the 
operand. The return value in the overloading function can be changed flexibly 
considering the data types after the operation and subsequent operations. For 
example, if you need additional operations, you need to change the function 
prototype and return value to return a reference. When overloading operators, it
is better to avoid types that are beyond the original intent. Otherwise, the 
code gets rather confused. Operator priorities and associativity do not change,
and overloading functions can not set defaults for parameters. It also can not 
take away the original function of the operator. In the case of the increment 
and decrement operators, the function must be created by separating the 
potential and posterior operations.
