Dynamic memory can be thought of as an address which points to static memory. 
When we size the memory, it is stored in the static memory. Therefore, if we 
change its size, we need to allocate new dynamic memory for the entire array.
Dynamically allocated memory has no scope. That is, it remains allocated until 
explicitly deallocated or the program terminates. However, pointers used to 
maintain dynamically allocated memory addresses follow the general variable 
scope rules. This discrepancy can cause errors such as Memory Leak. Memory leaks
occur when a program loses some bit addresses in dynamically allocated memory 
before returning to the operating system. When this happens, the program cannot
release dynamically allocated memory because the program does not know the 
dynamically allocated memory again. The operating system can not use this memory
because it is still in use by the program. 
When deleting dynamically allocated arrays, we must use the delete [] statement
instead of delete. This tells the CPU that multiple variables need to be cleaned
up instead of a single variable. Otherwise only the first element of the array 
will be deallocated and the other elements are inaccessible, which can lead to a
memory leak. However, CellPhone has a static memory which you do not have to 
worry about issues such as memory leaks caused by not releasing static memory. 
Static memory is not freed during execution, and the operating system recovers 
when the program terminates.
Function overloading means that several different functions share the same 
function name. As a condition of this,
- Overloading occurs when the number of parameters or data type is different.
- If the return type is different from the condition that the number of 
parameters and data type match, this is not established.
The compiler knows which definition to call from your main function with 
function signatures which are the function identifier, the parameter types and 
their order.

Quiz 2 Reflection:
2. What is passed to a C++ reference parameter?
I couldn't answer for this.
[Correct Answer]
Reference parameter is another name of variable's address by using &. The parameter passes the address.
Write down a piece of C++ code that 
a)allocates memory, 
b) stores the string "Strom" and deallocates the memory storage.

I tried to initialize the array but I forgot to put = " "
So I tried to write char weather[6] = " "; but I only write char weather[6]

[Correct Answer]
char *pweather;
pweather = new char[6];
strcpy(pweather, "Storm");
delete[] pweather;
